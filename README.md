# Classification between dogs and cats from images using CNN

The dataset for this project can be downloaded from [here](https://www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/)

The dataset consists of 10,000 images of dogs and cats each. The neural network learns the features from the images and predicts for new images, whether the image is of a cat or a dog. 

Model details:
- 2 layers.
- relu as activation function.
- adam optimzer
- binary crossentropy as loss function
